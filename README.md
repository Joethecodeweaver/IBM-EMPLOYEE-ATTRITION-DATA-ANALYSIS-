# IBM-EMPLOYEE-ATTRITION-DATA-ANALYSIS-
Employee attrition is a great challenge to organizations around the world.  Businesses lose talents regularly through attrition. For most businesses, employee attrition causes momentary slow-paced growth as it takes human, monetary, and time resources to fill a role. Businesses could avoid the negative impact of attrition if they have a system to  anticipate employees actions as regards resignation. Beyond that,  organizations can reduce employee turnover by identifying and addressing  factors that cause employee resignation. This project seeks to identify and analyze the factors contributing to employee attrition and also develop model to predict the employee attrition among the employees at IBM.
